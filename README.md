This is a [React](https://reactjs.org/) widget using the last tool in React library. I'm using [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to compile the code.


# Building

Previous to start to using this project you have to run **`npm install`** inside the project root.

You can use the script **`npm run build`** to compile the code and the script **`npm run lint`** to use the configurated linter *(Standard.js)* to validate the code.

## Running

You can use the the script **`npm start`** to start the dev server *(the code is compiled automatically)* and the application is launched in your default browser.
